# Understanding and Implementing Word Sense Disambiguation

## Description

This project aims to provide a practical understanding and implementation of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using TensorFlow in Python. 

WSD is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining which sense of a word is used in a sentence, especially when the word has multiple meanings. 

Our implementation focuses on distinguishing sentences that use the word "bear" in animal-related contexts from those that do not.
